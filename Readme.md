This is a Facial Expression Recognition Convolutional Neural Network model that is improved from WuJie's( WuJie1010 /Facial-Expression-Recognition.Pytorch Public) that is the most starred on Github. It enforces orthogonality on the kernel matrix(samaonline/Orthogonal-Convolutional-Neural-Networks), in order to achieve more diverse features and improve detection accuracy. 

The experiment on FER2013 DataSet shows its superiority than the original WuJie's scheme. For further understanding about the orthognality, it is introduces in the AVI2022 paper(https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3531073.3534470)
